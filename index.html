        <h1>The Story</h1>
        <p>
            This is a very simple website that is basically
            a sandbox for learning HTML. Accordingly, things will
            change <strong>often</strong> and <strong>nothing</strong> 
            contained herein should be taken too seriously, if at all. 
            <em>Paradox!</em>
        </p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Well, I started working on this earlier tonight. Would you like to 
            <a href="http://learnenough.com/email">sign up for something totally random?</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            (Soooo... Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the
            <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and the
            <a href="http://www.softcover.io/">Softcover publishing platform</a>.
            This page is part of the sample site for
            <a href="http://learnenough.com/html-tutorial"><em>Learn Enough HTML
            to Be Dangerous</em></a>, which teaches the basics of HTML and in exchange
            asks anyone completing the tutorial to gratuitously link to their content.
            <a href="http://learnenough.com/"><em>Like this</em></a>.)
        </p>
        <h2>Contributors</h2>
        <p>
            Currently there are only two contributors to this project.
            One of them is a <strong><em>cat</em></strong>. So basically there is just one contributor
            to the project considering how much the cat sleeps during work hours.
            <br>
            <br>
            Also, though it might seem unrelated: you can <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/mhartl">follow</a>
